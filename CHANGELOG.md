# Changelog

All notable changes to the htmlkit project on the `dev` branch are documented in this file.

---

## [dev] - Ongoing

### Added
- Modernized Python code and class naming conventions (e.g., `HtmlPage`, `ItemList`, `Table`, etc.).
- Comprehensive code cleanup: improved formatting, file handling, and consistent use of modern Python idioms.
- Detailed and clarifying code comments for all classes, methods, and functions.
- New, instructive, and example-driven manuals and documentation (`htmlkit.manual.md`, updated `README.md`).
- Backwards compatibility aliases: all original lowercase class/function names (`htmlpage`, `itemlist`, etc.) remain available for legacy code.

### Changed
- Class implementations refactored to safer, clearer, and more idiomatic Python (e.g., use of `with open(...)`, improved indentation, naming, and structure).
- All docstrings standardized or moved to clear `#`-style comments above the relevant code for coherence and readability.
- Public API documented and clarified for both legacy and modern use.

### Fixed
- Minor issues around file handling and resource management.
- Typos and ambiguous/wandering documentation in manuals and code comments.
